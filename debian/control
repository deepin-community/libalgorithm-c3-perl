Description: Perl module for merging hierarchies using the C3 algorithm
 The Algorithm::C3 module implements the C3 algorithm.
 .
 C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method resolution
 order under multiple inheritance. It was first introduced in the language
 Dylan, and then later adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order)
 for the new-style classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as
 the 'canonical' MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot
 objects as well.
